Guide to pmtr
=============
Troy D. Hanson

Pmtr is one of my http://troydhanson.github.io/[many C projects]. 
Back to the https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr[pmtr Github page].

.About

Back when I wrote pmtr in 2011, systemd had not yet been widely adopted.
For several years, it provided a uniform way to run a set of services across
various distributions. As systemd became widely adopted, it became the uniform
system manager, but pmtr ended up being useful in two secondary roles.

*On a host*: pmtr, running under systemd, is a quick way to run a group of
processes from a single configuration file

*In a container*: pmtr, as process 1, launches a set of processes when the
 container starts

In either case, pmtr keeps the processes running by restarting them when they
exit, or after a delay if they are restarting too quickly.

I wrote pmtr as a workalike to a proprietary process supervisor with these goals:

* a single configuration file lists the processes to run
* to create the managed processes in a standard execution context where the only
  open file descriptors are 0, 1, and 2 corresponding to standard input and
  output
* for the supervisory process to consume few resources, and collect any exited
  child processes
* to limit the restart rate of any failed or exiting child processes
* to signal child processes when the supervisory process itself is terminated
* to have no dependencies

It is written in C, supports Linux only, and is MIT licensed.

Over the years, pmtr has been used on many Linux variants including Ubuntu,
RHEL, Arch, Amazon Linux, Pi OS and others.

.Example /etc/pmtr.conf
--------------------------------------------------------
job {
  name tunnel
  cmd /usr/bin/ssh -i key -TNL 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 192.168.0.1
}

job {
  name demo-daemon
  dir /home/demo
  cmd /usr/bin/demod
  user demo
  env HOME=/home/demo
  cpu 0-8
}

job {
  name capture
  dir /data
  cmd /usr/sbin/tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -G 10 -w %Y%m%d%H%M%S.pcap
}
--------------------------------------------------------

When pmtr is started, it starts all the jobs in `pmtr.conf`, likewise, pmtr 
terminates them when it is stopped.

Any syntax errors in pmtr.conf are reported through syslog, which will 
be echoed to the container logs (when run as a container entrypoint) or,
on a systemd host, visible through `journalctl -u pmtr`.

Processes that run under pmtr should stay in the foreground, exit on SIGTERM or
SIGKILL, and clean up after their own sub-processes when exiting.

If a job exits, pmtr restarts it. If it exits too quickly- less than 10 seconds
after it started- pmtr delays its restart 10 seconds to avoid rapid cycling.

If the operator edits `pmtr.conf` and saves the file, the changes take effect
immediately. There is no need to tell pmtr to reload its configuration file.


Build & Install
---------------

To build pmtr from source follow these steps. 

.Clone pmtr

    git clone https://github.com/troydhanson/pmtr.git

.Build and install

    cd pmtr
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo cmake --install . --prefix=/usr

This will install the executable into /usr/bin/pmtr.

Testing
-------

Pmtr includes a comprehensive test suite with unit tests and integration tests.
To build and run the tests:

.Build with tests enabled (default)

    cd pmtr
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

.Run all tests

    ctest --output-on-failure

Or use the convenience target:

    make run_tests

.Run tests with verbose output

    make run_tests_verbose

.Build without tests

To build pmtr without the test suite, disable the BUILD_TESTS option:

    cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF ..

.Test Suites

The test suite includes:

* *test_tokenizer*: Tests for the configuration file tokenizer
* *test_setters*: Tests for configuration option parsing functions
* *test_job*: Tests for job management functions
* *test_integration*: Integration tests for full configuration file parsing
* *test_edge_cases*: Edge case tests for unusual but valid configurations

Each test suite runs independently and reports pass/fail status for each test.

.Usage as a container entrypoint

Dockerfile syntax to configure pmtr as the entrypoint is:

    ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/pmtr", "-Fc", "/etc/pmtr.conf"]

The pmtr options used above are

    -F        (run pmtr in the foreground, keeping container from exiting)
    -c <file> (path to pmtr configuration, defaults to /etc/pmtr.conf)

The pmtr logs will be sent to the container logs (e.g. `docker logs`).

.Usage as a systemd-managed service on a host

To set up pmtr to run under systemd on a host, build as shown above then
install the systemd service, enable and start pmtr (and cause pmtr to
start on future reboots), by issuing these commands:

    sudo cp pmtr.service /etc/systemd/system
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable pmtr.service
    sudo systemctl start pmtr.service

Config file
-----------

You can create an empty file called `/etc/pmtr.conf` and add temporary content
to get the hang of the pmtr configuration syntax, such as:

    job {
      name demo
      cmd /bin/sleep 20
    }

This is a minimal job having a name and a command.  Save the file. At this
point, if you execute pmtr in the foreground, you can see it run the job,

    pmtr -F -c /etc/pmtr.conf

You will see output like this:

    pmtr[21992]: pmtr: starting
    pmtr[21992]: started job demo [21994]
    pmtr[21992]: job demo [21994] exited after 20 sec: exit status 0
    pmtr[21992]: started job demo [21997]

You can see that pmtr is restarting it when the `sleep` exits every 20 seconds.
Press Ctrl-C to terminate pmtr and it will terminate the sleep subprocess too.

The config file can be changed to a different file using a command line option
(`pmtr -c <file>`).

As shown previously pmtr.conf consists of zero or more job definitions. An empty
`pmtr.conf` is valid, in which case pmtr will idle harmlessly. Add jobs using
the curly brace delimited syntax. Another example of a job:

  job {
    name demo
    cmd /usr/bin/date
    out /var/log/demo.out
    err /var/log/demo.err
  }

A job must have a `name` (used to improve log readability only) and a `cmd` at a
minimum. The contrived job above will log the date, and since it exits
immediately, pmtr will wait 10 seconds and then restart it. This limits the
impact of misconfigured, failing, or quick exiting jobs. If a job has been 
running more than ten seconds, then exits, pmtr will restart it immediately.

In the pmtr.conf syntax,

 * Indentation is optional.  
 * The order of options does not matter.
 * Blank lines are ok.
 * Comments start with `#`.  

You can run `pmtr -t -c /etc/pmtr.conf` to test the configuration file syntax.

Options
~~~~~~~

The full list of options that may appear inside a job are listed here.

.Job options
[width="90%",cols="20m,50",grid="none",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
|option         | argument

|wait           | (special) wait for the job to finish before going on
|once           | (special) do not restart the job
|===============================================================================

More details on each option follows.

cmd
~~~
* Specifies the *absolute path* to the executable (there is no $PATH searching!)
* It may have arguments after the executable (e.g. `cmd /usr/bin/python foo.py`)
* Use double-quotes to form a quoted string into a single argument.

There is no shell expansion: no wildcards, backticks, variables, etc.  If you
need shell features in your command, invoke it through a shell script.

env
~~~
* Sets an environment variable for a job, e.g. `env DEBUG=1`.
* Use repeatedly on separate lines to set multiple environment variables.

disable
~~~~~~~
* Use `disable` on a line by itself to make the job disabled.
* This is sometimes quicker than commenting out the whole job.

out, err, in
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use `out` and `err` to send stdout or stderr to a file.
* stdout and stderr go to syslog by default.
* stdin defaults to `/dev/null`; use `in` to override

nice
~~~~
* This changes the process priority
* Takes a number in the range -19 (highest priority) to 20 (lowest)

cpu
~~~~
* This sets the CPU affinity- the list of CPU's the task can run on
* Takes a CPU number (e.g. 0) or range (e.g. 2-4) or a mix (e.g. 0,2-4)
* Alternatively, can take a 0x-prefixed hex mask (e.g. 0x8f)
* Any CPUs in the set that are physically absent are ignored

user
~~~~
* Specifies the unix username to run the process as.
* That user's uid/gid becomes those of the process.
* Defaults to root (when pmtr is running as root)

depends
~~~~~~~
* Specifies a block of one or more files that the job depends on.
* pmtr watches the dependencies for changes to their content.
* Pmtr restarts the job if a change is detected.

  job {
    name demo-daemon
    dir /home/demo
    cmd /usr/bin/demod
    user demo
    env HOME=/home/demo
    depends {
      /home/demo/.demo/demo.conf
    }
  }

bounce every
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Use `bounce every` to restart a job on a periodic interval.
* It takes a number and unit [smhd] e.g. `bounce every 1d`.
* Units [smhd] are seconds, minutes, hours or days.
* The exact timing of the restart is approximate.

ulimit
~~~~~~
* Use to modify the system resource limits for the job.
* Takes a flag and value, e.g., `ulimit -n 30`.  
* Values are numeric or the keyword `infinity`.

To see the current limits on a process by its PID:

    cat /proc/<pid>/limits

Pmtr sets both the "hard" and "soft" limit to the same value.
Any error in setting the limit is logged to syslog.

See `man prlimit` for technical descriptions of each limit. 
In the `bash` shell, `ulimit -a` and `help ulimit` display the
limits and a list of flags and descriptions respectively.

.ulimit flags 
[width="80%",cols="20m,50",grid="none",options="none"]
|==========================================================================
|   -c |  the maximum size of core files created
|   -d |  the maximum size of a process's data segment
|   -e |  the maximum scheduling priority (taken as 20-limit)
|   -f |  the maximum size of files the process may create
|   -i |  the maximum number of pending signals
|   -l |  the maximum bytes a process may lock into memory
|   -m |  the maximum resident set size
|   -n |  the maximum number of open file descriptors
|   -q |  the maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
|   -r |  the maximum real-time scheduling priority
|   -s |  the maximum stack size
|   -t |  the maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
|   -u |  the maximum number processes or threads
|   -v |  the maximum size of process virtual memory
|==========================================================================

The units are discussed in the prlimit(2) man page.

wait/once
~~~~~~~~~
* Used for setup jobs that need not be restarted.
* `wait` pauses the startup of subsequent jobs.
* `once` tells pmtr not to restart this job.

    job {
      name initial-setup
      cmd /bin/mkdir /dev/shm/go
      wait
      once
    }

Operator notes
--------------

Pmtr detects writes to `pmtr.conf` and applies the changes immediately.
This allows a user to edit the config file manually, and save it, and
immediately have pmtr read the config file, taking appropriate action.

 * A newly-added job gets started.
 * A deleted job is terminated.
 * A changed job is restarted with its new configuration.

You can run `pmtr -t` to check the config file syntax and report any errors. 

Viewing the logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When pmtr is a container entrypoint, the pmtr logs can be viewed using `docker
logs` for that container.

On a host, use `journalctl -u pmtr` to view pmtr logs.

Checking status, and starting and stopping pmtr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the systemd management commands to start or stop pmtr or check the pmtr
status on a systemd-managed host.

  systemctl status pmtr 
  systemctl start pmtr 
  systemctl stop pmtr 

Behavior when a job exits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Jobs that exit on their own

If a job terminates by itself, when pmtr did not signal it to exit, (and the
job does not have the `once` option), pmtr restarts it. However, if it exited
within 10 seconds of when it started, pmtr waits 10 seconds to restart it. The
10-second wait prevents rapid process cycling.  Also, a job that's waiting for
something (like a network resource to come up) can be designed to exit instead
of retry, relying on pmtr to restart it periodically to try again.

.How pmtr terminates a job

Pmtr terminates a job when it is deleted, disabled, or altered in `pmtr.conf`,
or is being bounced due to the `bounce every` option; or because pmtr itself is
being shut down.  To terminate a job, pmtr sends SIGTERM to it, then SIGKILL
shortly afterward, if it's still running. 

Command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The host init system normally runs pmtr at system boot. You can instead run
pmtr manually. Or, it can be the init process inside a container. In these 
use cases, the following command line options may be useful.

.pmtr command-line options
[width="80%",cols="20m,50",grid="none",options="none"]
|==========================================================================
| -h        | show help    
| -F        | stay in foreground (enabled by default when PID 1)
| -c <file> | specify configuration file
| -t        | test syntax (parse config file and exit)
| -v        | verbose logging (repeatable), -vv shows parsing
| -p <file> | make pidfile
|==========================================================================

"onconnect" utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For processes that run in response to an accepted network connection,
pmtr includes a helper that will only run the process when a client
actually connects to that socket. Until then, only the socket listener
will run; when the client connects, the listener will fork and execute
the program to handle it. This is a way to defer running a network
service until a client connects to it. A new instance of the service
will be started for each client connection. To use it, configure a
job using the "onconnect" utility as the command, followed by the service
itself. For example, a hypothetical Gstreamer pipeline could be started
only upon a client connection on port 5000 like this:


    job {
      name gstreamer-job
      cmd /usr/bin/onconnect -p 5000 /path/to/gstreamer-job <args>
    }

The "onconnect" utility is built with pmtr and installed alongside it
so it will be in /usr/bin if you ran `cmake --install . --prefix=/usr`.

The full syntax for onconnect includes the ability to customize the
IP address it listens on (for a multihomed host); all is the default.

    onconnect [-a 0.0.0.0] -p <port> /process/to/fork [args]

When a client connection is made to this port, onconnect will fork 
and execute the named subprocess with the accepted client connection on
file descriptor 3. The subprocess must be coded to expect the client
connection on that descriptor.

UDP control
~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This feature is disabled by default.

These options may appear in `pmtr.conf` at the global scope.

  report to udp://127.0.0.1:9999
  listen on udp://0.0.0.0:10000

The `report to` option designates a remote address and port to which pmtr
should send a a UDP packet every ten seconds.  The packet payload lists the job
names, enabled or disabled status, and elapsed runtimes in simple text. If the
`report to` address falls in the multicast UDP range (e.g. 239.0.0.1, etc), the
specification may include a trailing interface, e.g., `report to
udp://239.0.0.1:9999@eth2` to designate the interface from which the multicast
UDP datagrams should egress. 

The `listen on` option allows jobs to be remotely enabled or disabled. It
specifies a UDP address and port that pmtr should listen on for datagrams of
form `enable abc` or `disable abc`, where 'abc' is a job name.  The address
0.0.0.0 can be used as a shortcut to denote "any address" on this system.  The
effect is temporary; the settings in pmtr.conf resume precedence when it's
edited or pmtr is restarted.

These options are considered experimental and may be replaced or removed.
